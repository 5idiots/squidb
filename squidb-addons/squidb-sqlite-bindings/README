When building from source, the jni/sqlite directory should also include the SQLite amalgamation source files, sqlite3.h and sqlite3.c.
They are not checked into version control, but can be downloaded from http://sqlite.org/download.html.
Pre-built binaries from the latest version of SQLite are included in the libs directory.
